 - Web Application and Web Site Difference
 - HTTP Request and Responce cycle 
 - Client and Server difference 
 
 - Client Side : 
		HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, 
		
 - Server Side : / Backend 
		Python and Django  

 - DataBase : 
		Postgres, 
			

Pycharm ; Virtual Environment ; packages (django, psycopg2);




1) Create a Python project in system with virtual env 
2) installed a django package in it using the command - pip install django 
3) Create a django Project 
	- django-admin startproject project_name 
*) move our project command directory inside newly created project file 
	- cd project_name
	
4) manage.py is command-line utility for administrative tasks. It manages our project 
5) For Starting a development server we have hit a command  |  port : 8000 
	- python manage.py runserver 
	
6) We need to perform migrations, for creating and updating database operations 
	- use below command to check the exsiting migrations 
		python manage.py makemigrations 
		
	- use below command to add the migrations into database
		python manage.py migrate  

	
7) Django Provides a Admin Interface which is used to perform administrative operation in application 
8) How to create an Admin ?
	use below command : 
		python manage.py createsuperuser 
	
	add the username and password (password is not visible)

9) How to see the packages used in our project ? 
	use below command to add the required packages of your application 
		pip freeze> requirement.txt



10)	we have created a APP based on our need (we are going to manage school so, App name is school)
		to create a APP use below command, 
		
			- python manage.py startapp <APP_NAME> 
				eg. python manage.py startapp school
				
	- As soon as we have created app need to add the name (school) of APP inside INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py 
			
11) MVT : (Models, Views, Templates)
		- Create templates
		- views 
		- render function 
		- urls 	
		
12) we are including urls of APP(school) inside the urlsconfig file. 
	for that we are using a include() function from django.urls by importing into the Urls file 
	
	eg . 
			from django.urls import path, include

			urlpatterns = [
				path('', include('school.urls'))
			]
	by this We can acess the urls file from school App into our main urlsconfig file. 
	
13) Now we will write all the urls of school inside that file which is there in school App 

	eg, 
		from django.urls import path
		from . import views
			urlpatterns = [
				path('home/', views.home, name='Home'),
				path('home_http/', views.home_http, name='HTTP')
		]

14) Now we are going to follow MVT arch. 
	So, for each path in urls there should be views function as logic,
